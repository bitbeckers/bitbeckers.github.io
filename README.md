Reverie is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)-powered theme which is simple and opinionated. It's actually a fork of [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) with some additional features and personal touches which I've implemented to suit my needs for my blog.

This is a plug-and-play Jekyll theme best suited to use on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) without even setting up a local environment.
