## Robofriends

My first real project on the [Zero-to-Mastery Complete Web Developer](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/) course, using React and some API calls. It's not pretty, but you gotta start somewhere, right?

## Star Wars API Explorer

Second project of [Zero-to-Mastery Complete Web Developer](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/) course, using React and the Star Wars API. Still work in progress, but the target is connecting information from multiple API calls. To be continued :)
